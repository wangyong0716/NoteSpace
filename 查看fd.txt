You can check the descriptor limit on your device calling:
 adb shell ulimit -n

As a first step to solve the issue, you might need to figure out what kind of resources are leaking. You can figure out the process ID of your app by:
 adb shell ps

Then using the process ID, while your app is still running, you can check for open descriptors (you need root access):
 adb shell ls -l  /proc/[YOUR_PROCESS_ID]/fd

For the process 12345 it would be something like:
 adb shell ls -l  /proc/12345/fd
This will list the descriptors. On older android versions you can have 1024 items in the list, on Lollipop I saw 2048 as the default limit.

You don't need root access to see the file descriptors: 
 adb shell run-as $yourApplicationId ls -l /proc/$yourProcessId/fd/. E.g., adb shell run-as com.mycompany.myapplication ls -l /proc/12345/fd
